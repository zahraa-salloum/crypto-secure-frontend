## 🔒 Security Features

- Token-based authentication with Sanctum (stored in sessionStorage)
- Automatic token refresh every 15 minutes via `POST /auth/refresh`
- Session timeout: forced logout after 1 hour of user inactivity
- Route guards for authenticated and admin-only routes
- HTTP interceptors for auth token injection and error handling
- Password strength validation (uppercase, number, special character)
- XSS prevention via Angular's built-in sanitization
- Content Security Policy headers
- Input validation on all forms

## 📚 Implemented Features

### Authentication
- ✅ Register with password strength validation
- ✅ Login with redirect logic (admin → /admin, user → /dashboard)
- ✅ Forgot password (sends reset email)
- ✅ Reset password with token + email from URL
- ✅ Change password from profile

### Admin Panel
- ✅ Platform statistics (users, files, messages, storage)
- ✅ User list with search and role filter
- ✅ Create users (admin or regular)
- ✅ Ban / unban users

### Dashboard
- ✅ Stats overview (encrypted chats, files, messages)
- ✅ Quick action links

### Encrypted Chat
- ✅ Start conversations with other users
- ✅ Client-side RC4 / A5/1 message encryption
- ✅ Per-message nonce combined with key to prevent keystream reuse
- ✅ Per-conversation encryption key
- ✅ Messages stored encrypted on server
- ✅ Auto-scroll to bottom on conversation open and new message
- ✅ Loading spinner while messages fetch; stale messages cleared immediately on switch
- ✅ Mobile back-to-list navigation
- ✅ **File sharing in chat**: queue a file from /files → navigate to /chat → send as an encrypted file card
- ✅ Recipient clicks Download, enters decryption key manually (key never transmitted)
- ✅ Deleted files detected at load time via batch API — Download button replaced with “🗑️ File deleted” label

### File Encryption
- ✅ Client-side file encryption (RC4 or A5/1) before upload
- ✅ Encrypted file storage on server
- ✅ Client-side decryption on download
- ✅ Key never sent to server
- ✅ Per-user file limit (10 files)
- ✅ "Share in Chat" button — queues a file for sending in a conversation

### Text Encryption Tool
- ✅ Encrypt/decrypt text with RC4 or A5/1
- ✅ Copy to clipboard

### Profile
- ✅ Update display name
- ✅ Upload avatar (stored as base64)
- ✅ Change password with live strength checklist (length, uppercase, number, special char)
- ✅ Delete account

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

Edit `src/environments/environment.ts` for development:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api',
  maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
  tokenRefreshInterval: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  sessionTimeout: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
};
```

For production, `src/environments/environment.production.ts` is used automatically.

## 📦 Key Dependencies
